Create a Java program to manage a National Football Team. The team consists of players categorized into four groups: Goalkeepers, Defenders, Midfielders, and Forwards. Each player in the team has common attributes such as:

1. Name (String)
2. Player Number (int)
3. Age (int)
4. Nationality (String)

In addition to these shared attributes, players from each category (goalkeepers, defenders, midfielders, forwards) have unique skills or responsibilities:

1. Goalkeepers have a special attribute cleanSheets (int) to track the number of clean sheets (matches without conceding goals).
2. Defenders have an attribute tacklesMade (int) to track the number of tackles completed.
3. Midfielders have an attribute assists (int) to track the number of assists provided.
4. Forwards have an attribute goalsScored (int) to track the number of goals scored.

Use inheritance to define the relationship, and apply encapsulation to ensure data protection. Implement getter and setter methods for all attributes, and demonstrate how to:

Add players to the respective categories.
Display details of all players in the team.
Update and retrieve individual statistics (e.g., clean sheets, goals scored).
